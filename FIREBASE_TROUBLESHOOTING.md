# Firebase Authentication Troubleshooting

## Current Status
✅ Firebase configuration is loading correctly
✅ All environment variables are present
✅ AuthProvider structure is fixed

## Most Likely Issues

### 1. Authentication Method Not Enabled
Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method
- Ensure **Email/Password** is enabled
- Click on Email/Password and toggle "Enable"

### 2. Authorized Domains
Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
- Add your Replit domain: `*.replit.dev`
- Add localhost for development: `localhost`

### 3. Firebase Project Settings
Verify these match your environment variables:
- Project ID: `tripwhiz-c81d1`
- Auth domain: `tripwhiz-c81d1.firebaseapp.com`

## Test Steps
1. Try signing up with any email and password (min 6 characters)
2. Check browser console for specific error messages
3. If you see "operation-not-allowed", enable Email/Password authentication
4. If you see "unauthorized-domain", add the domain to authorized list

## Firebase Console Links
- Authentication: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/tripwhiz-c81d1/authentication
- Project Settings: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/tripwhiz-c81d1/settings/general

The authentication system should work once the Email/Password sign-in method is enabled in your Firebase console.
